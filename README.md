# Prediction of local concentration fields in porous media with chemical reaction using a multi scale convolutional neural network

Fork of Javier Santos' [MS-Net](https://github.com/je-santos/ms_net), modified for use in the prediction of scalar fields in porous reactive systems.

In this repository we share the Pytorch code of MSNet employed for our article published in the [Chemical Engineering Journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894722058478). The network has been trained to predict the concentration fields of a reactive species in 2D porous media. The trained network can generalize on new geometries and operating conditions (Reynolds and PÃ©clet numbers).

## Workflow
The following illustration shows how the information flows through the individual networks (left).
MSNet has been trained on a dataset of CFD simulations of reactive transport (right).

In this work both geometrical features (euclidean distance transform and time of flight) and operating conditions (pressure/diffusion coefficient) are employed as input to the network. 

## Dataset availablity

Data available here

## Usage

```python
import torch

from network import MS_Net
from pore_utils import load_samples, concat_features
from network_tools import get_masks


net = MS_Net( 
              num_scales    := 6,  # num of trainable convNets
              num_features  = 3,   # input features (Euclidean distance, time of flight, operating conditions)
              num_filters   = 2,   # num of kernels on each layer of the finest model (most expensive)
              summary       = True # print the model summary
)

file_name = 'sample_x'
operating_conditions = 00

x_edist = load_samples( feat='edist', sample_name = file_name, scales = num_scales)
x_tof   = load_samples( feat='tof', sample_name = file_name, scales = num_scales)
x_p_D   = load_samples( feat='p/D', sample_name = file_name, scales = num_scales, p_D = operating_conditions)

x = concat_features(feats = [x_edist, x_tof, x_p_D])
masks = get_masks( x_edist[-1],    scales = num_scales )
y     = net( x, masks )[-1] # final prediction
```
